\hline
 & Bitflip & 0.92 & accuracy steadily decreases with increase in noise parameter till around 0.5 , then stays constant to near 0.6 then again decrease\\ 
\hline
&Phaseflip & 0.94 & accuracy stays constant till 0.2 p-value,then it decreases to 0.86 then reaches a peak of 0.94 , then decreases again to 0.86 then  , stays constant at 0.5 to 0.6 then again decreases\\
\hline
&Bitphaseflip &0.88 &  accuracy increases, makes a peak, then decreases, stays constant at 0.5 to 0.6 then again decreases\\
\hline
&Depolarizing & 0.87 &  accuracy steadily decreases with increase in noise parameter\\
\hline
&Amplitude Damping & 0.92 & Accuracy steadily Decreases with increase in noise parameter and get's steady after certain point near 0.3\\
\hline
&Phase Damping &0.92 &accuracy decreases and increases again, it repeat for 3 times,the lowest it reaches 0.86\\
\hline
QHLO (for 6/8) & No Noise & 1 & accuracy fluctuates, from 0.95 to 1.0 \\ 
\hline
& Bitflip & 0.98 & accuracy decreases with decrease in Noise parameters\\ 
\hline
